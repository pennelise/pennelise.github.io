                The hydroxyl radical (OH) is known as the "detergent of the atmosphere" for its role in removing atmospheric pollutants. Understanding OH is critical for atmospheric chemistry models because it is the main oxidant which governs the lifetimes of atmospheric gasses. Presently, global mean OH is inferred by examining the decay of methyl chloroform, an industrial solvent which was banned in 1993. However, methyl chloroform is expected to decay below detection limits in 2025. A replacement technique for detecting OH is a pressing need for atmospheric chemists.

                The goal of this project is to constrain OH and its interannual variability using satellite observations of methane. Concentrations of OH are highest in the middle troposphere (about 3-5 miles high in the atmosphere). In order to gain more sensitivity to OH, I am combining measurements from a traditional short-wave infrared instrument (which is equally sensitive to the whole tropospheric column) with a thermal infrared instrument (which has increased sensitivity to the middle troposphere)

                Nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub> = NO + NO<sub>2</sub>) are trace gasses which promote formation of air pollutants including ozone and nitrate aerosols. 
NO<sub>x</sub> photolyzes in the sunlight, and as a result has a strong daily cycle, with a peak in the morning and a minimum in the late afternoon. 
Nitrogen oxides are observed at the surface by the sparse network of EPA AQS monitors, and NO<sub>2</sub> in particular is observed remotely by satellite instruments including OMI, TROPOMI, and GOME-2. 
The current polar-orbiting satellite instruments can only measure at a single time over each location. For example, many satellites measure at only 1pm local time, near the minimum of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                We used satellite observations from two instruments with different overpasses, GOME-2 (at ~9:30am) and OMI (at ~1:45pm local time) to assess. We found that satellite observations show evidence of higher NO<sub>2</sub> in the morning near large urban areas, but further analysis of urban/suburban interactions is limited by resoluton constraints.

                Wind farm operators need to predict their power production 24 hours in advance so that they can submit accurate predictions to the grid operators. These predictions are imperfect, and the wind industry loses over $300 million each year to inaccurate power forecasts. Wind turbine power production depends in part on the amount of wind shear and turbulence in the surrounding atmosphere. However, these effects are not well understood and can be highly dependent on local conditions. We used a random forest model to incorporate shear and turbulence, as well as local information like altitude, to predict power production at a wind farm. We found that the new model, which incorporated more localized atmospheric information, outperformed the standard industry wind curve.
